NETLab Toolkit JavaScript version

DISCLAIMER: This is an active development branch and is quite far from being "ready for primetime"

You must first install node and npm if you have not done so.

If you are on Raspberry Pi, then you probably have an outdated version of Node. Here's a nice & easy upgrade method: https://github.com/DonaldDerek/rPi-cheat-sheet

You will also need to install command-line tools, bower, and grunt if you do not have them already as well as Compass in the current version:
```
npm install -g grunt-cli
npm install -g bower
npm install -g grunt

sudo gem update â€”system
sudo gem install compass
```

To install this version of NETLab Toolkit:
```
git clone https://github.com/netlabtoolkit/widgets-html5.git
cd widgets-html5
bower install
npm install
```
To run a live-reload development server after installation run grunt in that directory:
```
grunt
```
or to run it as a standard application, run:
```
node server/app.js
```

If you want to produce a version that can be installed on a Raspberry Pi (or other embedded system) you have to currently do this manually. Run (on your laptop/desktop):
```
grunt build
```

Then copy the dist directory into the server directory. Rename it to "app" and comment out the lines labeled with the comment:
```
// For distributable version, comment out the above and uncomment the line below
```
