NETLab Toolkit JavaScript version

DISCLAIMER: This is an active development branch and is quite far from being "ready for primetime"

You must first install node and npm if you have not done so.

If you are on Raspberry Pi, then you probably have an outdated version of Node. Here's a nice & easy upgrade method: https://github.com/DonaldDerek/rPi-cheat-sheet

You will also need to install command-line tools, bower, and grunt if you do not have them already as well as Compass in the current version:
```
npm install -g grunt-cli
npm install -g bower
npm install -g grunt

sudo gem update â€”system
sudo gem install compass
```

To install this version of NETLab Toolkit:
```
git clone https://github.com/netlabtoolkit/widgets-html5.git
cd widgets-html5
bower install
npm install
```
To run a live-reload development server after installation run grunt in that directory:
```
grunt
```
or to run it as a standard application, run:
```
node server/app.js
```

Creating a New Widget
---------------------
Copy the Blank Widget folder located in the /app/scripts/views directory and name this new folder with the name of your widget. Rename the view file to your widget name (e.g. MyCustomWidget.js). You may also want to create and edit the corresponding .scss file in the /app/styles directory.

The widget folder contains two files. A view file (e.g. Blank.js) and a template file (template.js). Open the view file to see comments on building out a custom view. In the view file, be sure to change names of the typeID, className and title to your new widget name. Also, rename the view file to your widget name (e.g. MyCustomWidget.js).

Adding Your Custom Widget to WidgetMap.js
------------------------
When you are ready to test and run your widget you will need to add it into the system by opening the WidgetMap.js file located in the same directory (/app/scripts/views). There are three changes that need to be made to this file.

1) Look at the top of the file in the define section:
```
define([
	'views/Blank/Blank',
	'views/AnalogIn',
	'views/AnalogOut',
	'views/Code',
	'views/ElementControl',
],
```
and add your widget like so:
```
define([
	'views/Blank/Blank',
	'views/AnalogIn',
	'views/AnalogOut',
	'views/Code',
	'views/ElementControl',
	'views/MyCustomWidget/MyCustomWidget',
],
```
Note that the ".js" at the end of the file is unnecessary.

2) Then pass the widget into the function call as a parameter (order is very important. Always add to the end):
```
function(Blank, AnalogIn, AnalogOut, Code, ElementControl){

...

function(Blank, AnalogIn, AnalogOut, Code, ElementControl, MyCustomWidget){
```

3) And finally, add your widget to the map like so:
```
	return {
		'Blank': Blank,
		'Analog In': AnalogIn,
		'Analog Out': AnalogOut,
		'Code': Code,
		'Element Control': ElementControl,
	};

...

	return {
		'Blank': Blank,
		'Analog In': AnalogIn,
		'Analog Out': AnalogOut,
		'Code': Code,
		'Element Control': ElementControl,
		'The typeID of My Custom Widget View': MyCustomWidget,
	};
```


This will both add the widget to the lefthand toolbar and allow your widget to be loaded from the GUI.
That's it!
