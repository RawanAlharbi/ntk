DISCLAIMER: This is an active development branch and is quite far from being "ready for primetime"

You must first install node and npm if you have not done so.

If you are on Raspberry Pi, then you probably have an outdated version of Node. Here's a nice & easy upgrade method: http://joshondesign.com/2013/10/23/noderpi

To install this version of NETLab Toolkit:
```
git clone https://github.com/netlabtoolkit/widgets-html5.git
cd widgets-html5
bower install
npm install
```
To run the server after installation run grunt in that directory:
```
grunt
```
